# Signed Requests

A common URL authentication method known as *request signing* can be implemented in a Worker with the help of the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).

In the example presented here, we'll authenticate the path of a URL, along with an accompanying expiration timestamp, using a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with a SHA-256 digest algorithm. For a user agent to successfully fetch an authenticated resource, they'll need to provide the correct path, expiration timestamp, and HMAC via query parameters --- if any of those three are tampered with, the request will fail.

Note that the authenticity of the expiration timestamp is covered by the HMAC, so we can rely on the user-provided timestamp being correct if the HMAC is correct, and thus know when the URL expires. Moreover, the user can also determine whether a URL in their possession has expired or not.

## Verifying signed requests

This example verifies the HMAC for any request URL whose pathname starts with `/verify/`.

For debugging convenience, this Worker returns 403 if the URL or HMAC is invalid, or if the URL has expired. You may wish to return 404 in an actual implementation.

``` javascript
// We'll need some super-secret data to use as a symmetric key.
const encoder = new TextEncoder()
const SECRET_KEY_DATA = encoder.encode("my secret symmetric key")

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(verifyAndFetch(event.request))
})

async function verifyAndFetch(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)

  // If the path doesn't begin with our protected prefix, just pass the request
  // through.
  if (!url.pathname.startsWith("/verify/")) {
    return fetch(request)
  }

  // Make sure we have the minimum necessary query parameters.
  if (!url.searchParams.has("mac") || !url.searchParams.has("expiry")) {
    return new Response("Missing query parameter", { status: 403 })
  }

  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw", secretKeyData,
    { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
    false, [ "verify" ]
  )

  // Extract the query parameters we need and run the HMAC algorithm on the
  // parts of the request we're authenticating: the path and the expiration
  // timestamp.
  const expiry = Number(url.searchParams.get("expiry"))
  const dataToAuthenticate = url.pathname + expiry

  // The received MAC is Base64-encoded, so we have to go to some trouble to
  // get it into a buffer type that crypto.subtle.verify() can read.
  const receivedMacBase64 = url.searchParams.get("mac")
  const receivedMac = byteStringToUint8Array(atob(receivedMacBase64))

  // Use crypto.subtle.verify() to guard against timing attacks. Since HMACs use
  // symmetric keys, we could implement this by calling crypto.subtle.sign() and
  // then doing a string comparison -- this is insecure, as string comparisons
  // bail out on the first mismatch, which leaks information to potential
  // attackers.
  const verified = await crypto.subtle.verify(
    "HMAC", key,
    receivedMac,
    encoder.encode(dataToAuthenticate)
  )

  if (!verified) {
    const body = "Invalid MAC"
    return new Response(body, { status: 403 })
  }

  if (Date.now() > expiry) {
    const body = `URL expired at ${new Date(expiry)}`
    return new Response(body, { status: 403 })
  }

  // We've verified the MAC and expiration time; we're good to pass the request
  // through.
  return fetch(request)
}

// Convert a ByteString (a string whose code units are all in the range
// [0, 255]), to a Uint8Array. If you pass in a string with code units larger
// than 255, their values will overflow!
function byteStringToUint8Array(byteString) {
  const ui = new Uint8Array(byteString.length)
  for (let i = 0; i < byteString.length; ++i) {
    ui[i] = byteString.charCodeAt(i)
  }
  return ui
}
```

## Generating signed requests

Typically, the signed request would be delivered to the user in some out-of-band way, such as email, or actually generated by the user themself if they also possess the symmetric key. We can, of course, also generate the signed requests in a Worker.

For any request URL beginning with `/generate/`, we'll replace `/generate/` with `/verify/`, sign the resulting path with its timestamp, and return the full, signed URL via the response body.

``` javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  const url = new URL(event.request.url)
  const prefix = "/generate/"
  if (url.pathname.startsWith(prefix)) {
    // Replace the "/generate/" path prefix with "/verify/", which we
    // use in the first example to recognize authenticated paths.
    url.pathname = `/verify/${url.pathname.slice(prefix.length)}`
    event.respondWith(generateSignedUrl(url))
  } else {
    event.respondWith(fetch(event.request))
  }
})

async function generateSignedUrl(url) {
  // We'll need some super-secret data to use as a symmetric key.
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const secretKeyData = encoder.encode("my secret symmetric key")
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw", secretKeyData,
    { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
    false, [ "sign" ]
  )

  // Signed requests expire after one minute. Note that you could choose
  // expiration durations dynamically, depending on, e.g. the path or a query
  // parameter.
  const expirationMs = 60000
  const expiry = Date.now() + expirationMs
  const dataToAuthenticate = url.pathname + expiry

  const mac = await crypto.subtle.sign(
    "HMAC", key,
    encoder.encode(dataToAuthenticate)
  )

  // `mac` is an ArrayBuffer, so we need to jump through a couple hoops to get
  // it into a ByteString, then a Base64-encoded string.
  const base64Mac = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(mac)))

  url.searchParams.set("mac", base64Mac)
  url.searchParams.set("expiry", expiry)

  return new Response(url)
}
```
