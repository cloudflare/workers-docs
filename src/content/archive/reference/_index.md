## JavaScript / ECMAScript

Cloudflare Workers uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome. The Workers runtime is updated at least once a week, to at least the version that is currently used by Chrome's stable release. This means you can safely use latest JavaScript features, with no need for "transpilers".

## Standard APIs

This is a summary of the JavaScript APIs available to Cloudflare Worker scripts, and links to their
documentation on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/). Cloudflare currently implements a
subset of these APIs, as shown on this table. We are adding support for more APIs all the
time -- [let us know](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/developers/workers) if we're missing one
you need.

[^request-ctx]: Some APIs are only available inside a *request context*. A request
    context is active during a `"fetch"` event callback, and, if you pass a Response promise to
    `FetchEvent.respondWith()`, any asynchronous tasks which run before the Response promise has
    settled. Any attempt to use such APIs during script startup will throw an exception.

    For example:

    ```js
const promise = fetch("https://example.com/")       // ERROR

addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(fetch("https://example.com/"))  // OK
})
```

    This code snippet **will throw** during script startup, and the `"fetch"` event
    listener will never be registered.

[^no-playground]: Some APIs are only available in production, and not in the *playground*.
    The playgrounds are the Workers instances which power cloudflareworkers.com and the
    Workers editor UI on dash.cloudflare.com. They do not currently provide Cloudflare features
    other than Workers.
