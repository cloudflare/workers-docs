title: "Conditionally Changing a URL"
---

To conditionally change a URL based on the domain, your Worker code will look something like this:

## With VCL:
```vcl
if (req.http.host ~ "^restricted") {
  set req.url = "/sanitized" req.url;
}
```


## With Workers:
```js
let url = new URL(request.url);
if (url.hostname.startsWith("restricted")) {
  url.pathname = "/sanitized" + url.pathname;
}
```
