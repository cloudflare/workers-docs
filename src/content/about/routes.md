The mechanics for if and what script should run on a request based on the URL.

## Workers.dev

For workers.dev zones, scripts are managed by the name of the script. A request to your `script-name.subdomain.workers.dev` subdomain will run through the active script with corresponding name, `script-name`.

All the logic for routing must be done in the script itself. For example, you can use the [router template](/templates/boilerplates/router).

Each script that runs must have a script name, so there is currently no way to run a script on `subdomain.workers.dev`.

## Custom Zones

For zones proxied on Cloudflare\*, route patterns decide what (if any) script is matched based on the URL of that request. Requests are routed through a Workers script when the URL matches a route pattern assigned to that script.

Route patterns can be added using the Cloudflare API or by going to the [Workers tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=workers) after selecting a zone.

Cloudflare Site routes are comprised of:

- Route URL (see [Matching Behavior](#matching-behavior))
- Worker script to execute on matching requests
- Failure mode for rate-limited accounts on the free plan (see [Daily Request Limits](/about/limits#request-limits))

\* _A zone that you have registered with some registrar (not workers.dev) and setup Cloudflare to serve as [a reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)._

### Matching Behavior

Route patterns look like this:

```
https://*.example.com/images/*
```

This pattern would match all HTTPS requests destined for a subhost of
example.com and whose paths are prefixed by `/images/`.

A pattern to match all requests looks like this:

```
*example.com/*
```

While they look similar to a [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) pattern, route patterns follow specific rules:

- The only supported operator is wildcard `*` which matches zero or more of any character.
- Route patterns may not contain infix wildcards or query parameters, e.g.
  neither `example.com/*.jpg` nor `example.com/?foo=*` are valid route patterns.
- When more than one route pattern could match a request URL, the most specific
  route pattern wins. For example, the pattern `www.example.com/*` would take
  precedence over `*.example.com/*` when matching a request for
  `https://www.example.com/`.
- Route pattern matching considers the entire request URL, including the query
  parameter string. Since route patterns may not contain query parameters, the
  only way to have a route pattern match URLs with query parameters is to
  terminate it with a wildcard, `*`.

A route can be specified without being associated with a worker; this will act to negate any less specific patterns. For example, consider this pair of route patterns, one with a Workers script and one without:

```
*example.com/images/cat.png -> <no script>
*example.com/images/*       -> worker-script
```

In this example, all requests destined for example.com and whose paths are prefixed by `/images/` would be routed to `worker-script`, _except_ for `/images/cat.png`, which would bypass Workers completely. Requests with a path of `/images/cat.png?foo=bar` would be routed to `worker-script`, due to the presence of the query string.

### Validity

Here is the full set of rules governing route pattern validity:

- **Route patterns must include your zone**

    If your zone is `example.com`, then the simplest possible route pattern you
  can have is `example.com`, which would match `http://example.com/` and
  `https://example.com/`, and _nothing else_.
  As with a URL, there is an implied path of `/` if you do not specify one.

- **Route patterns may not contain any query parameters**

    For example, `https://example.com/?anything` is not a valid route pattern.

- **Route patterns may optionally begin with http:// or https://**

    If you omit a scheme in your route pattern, it will match both http:// and
    https:// URLs. If you include http:// or https://, it will only match HTTP
    or HTTPS requests, respectively.

  - `https://*.example.com/` matches `https://www.example.com/` but _not_ `http://www.example.com/`

  - `*.example.com/` matches both `https://www.example.com/` _and_ `http://www.example.com/`.

- **Hostnames may optionally begin with `*`**

    If a route pattern hostname begins with `*`, then it matches the host *and* all subhosts.
    If a route pattern hostname begins with `*.`, then it matches *only* all subhosts.
   - `*example.com/` matches `https://example.com/` *and* `https://www.example.com/`

   - `*.example.com/` matches `https://www.example.com/` but *not* `https://example.com/`

- **Paths may optionally end with `*`**

    If a route pattern path ends with `*`, then it matches all suffixes of that
  path.
    - `https://example.com/path*` matches `https://example.com/path` _and_
      `https://example.com/path2` _and_ `https://example.com/path/readme.txt`

    - `https://example.com/path/*` matches `https://example.com/path/readme.txt`
      but _not_ `https://example.com/path2`.

- **Subdomains must have a DNS Record**

    All subdomains must have a [DNS record](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019093151#h_60566325041543261564371) to be proxied on Cloudflare and compatible with Workers. For example if you have the route pattern `*.example.com` and no DNS records, any request to subdomain.example.com will result in the error `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`.
