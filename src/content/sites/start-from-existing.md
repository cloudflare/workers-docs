Workers Sites require [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) - make sure to be on the [latest version](/quickstart/#updating-the-cli) - and the Workers [Unlimited plan](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites#plans).

To deploy a pre-existing static site project, you'll need to start with a pre-generated site. Workers Sites works well with all static site generators! For a quick-start, check out the following projects:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/), requires Node
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), requires Ruby
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/#quick-start), requires Node
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (see our tutorial on [deploying static WordPress sites with Workers](/tutorials/hosting-static-wordpress-sites))

Once you have a site generated, follow these steps:

1. Run this Wrangler command in the root of your project's directory:

    ```
    $ wrangler init --site my-static-site
    ```
    This command creates a few things: `wrangler.toml` and a`workers-site` directory.
2. Add your site's build directory to the `wrangler.toml`:
  ```
  [site]
  bucket = "./public" # <-- Add your build directory name here!
  entry-point = "workers-site"
  ```
The default directories for the most popular static site generators are listed below:

  - Hugo: `public`
  - Gatsby: `public`
  - Jekyll: `_site`
  - Eleventy: `_site`

3.  Add your `account_id` your `wrangler.toml`. You can find your `account_id` on the right sidebar of the Workers or Overview Dashboard. Note: You may need to scroll down! For more details on finding your `account_id` click [here](/quickstart/#account-id-and-zone-id).

4.  You can preview your site by running:

    ```
    wrangler preview --watch
    ```

5.  Decide where you'd like to publish your site to: [ a workers.dev subdomain](/quickstart#publish-to-workers-dev) or your [personal domain](/quickstart#publish-to-your-domain) registered with Cloudflare.
    Then, update your `wrangler.toml`:

	- **Personal Domain**: Add your `zone_id` and a `route`.

    ```
    zone_id = "42ef.."
    route = "example.com/*"
    ```

  - **workers.dev**: Set `workers_dev` to true. This is the default.

    You can learn more about configuring your project [here](/quickstart/#configure).
  
6. Run:
   ```
   wrangler publish
   ```
