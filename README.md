# Cloudflare Workers Documents

This project contains the static website content for Workers documentation.  Currently,
this pushes content up to our internal s3 buckets.

## Installation

After checking this project from Stash, ensure you have the the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview)
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) version 0.32.2
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 9


## Usage

All commands are packaged in the make file.  While all commands could be run locally, usually it's easier to use the docker versions of the commands.  Available commands are:

- `build` - generate HTML files from MD and templates.
- `deploy` - deploy documents
- `serve` - generate HTML files continuously and serve at localhost:1313/workers/ to iterate content

The most useful option on a normal basis is:

    make serve

You can now edit the .md files and the HTML files will be autogenerated.  When done editing and ready to publish, commit your changes and push to master. A build should kick off and autodeploy your new changes to s3.
