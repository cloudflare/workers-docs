### üëØ `generate`

  Scaffold a project, including boilerplate for a Rust library and a Cloudflare Worker.
  You can pass a name and template to this command optionally.

  ```bash
  wrangler generate <name> <template> --type=["webpack", "javascript", "rust"] --site
  ```

  All of the arguments and flags to this command are optional:

  - `name`: defaults to `worker`
  - `template`: defaults to the [`https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template)
  - `type`: defaults to ["webpack"](/tooling/wrangler/webpack)

  - `--site`: generates a [Workers Site](/sites) from an exisiting static site

### üì• `init`

  Creates a skeleton `wrangler.toml` in an existing directory. This can be used as an alternative to `generate` if you prefer to clone a repository yourself.

  ```bash
  wrangler init <name> --type=["webpack", "javascript", "rust"] --site
  ```

  All of the arguments and flags to this command are options:

  - `name`: defaults to the name of your working directory
  - `type`: defaults to ["webpack"](/tooling/wrangler/webpack).
  
  - `--site`: generates a [Workers Site](/sites) from an exisiting static site

### ü¶Ä‚öôÔ∏è `build`

  Build your project. This command looks at your `wrangler.toml` file and runs the build steps associated
  with the `"type"` declared there.

  Additionally, you can build different environments. This is useful if you have different builds for different environments, but typically isn't needed. For more information see the [environments documentation](/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments).

### üîß `config`

  Configure your global Cloudflare user. This is an interactive command that will prompt you for your API token:

  ```bash
  wrangler config
  Enter API token:
  superlongapitoken
  ```

  You can also provide your email and global API key (this is not recommended for security reasons):
  ```bash
  wrangler config --api-key
  Enter email:
  testuser@example.com
  Enter global API key:
  superlongapikey
  ```

  You can also [use environment variables](/tooling/wrangler/configuration/) to configure these values.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è üÜô `publish`

  Publish your Worker to Cloudflare. Several keys in your `wrangler.toml` determine whether you are publishing to a workers.dev subdomain or your own registered domain, proxied through Cloudflare.

  ```bash
  wrangler publish
  ```

  To use this command, the following fields are required in your `wrangler.toml`.

| Key        | Value                                                        | Example                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| name       | the name of your worker                                      | `name = "your-worker"`                            |
| type       | build type (webpack, rust, or javascript)                    | `type = "webpack"`                                |
| account_id | your Cloudflare account ID, this can be found in the Cloudflare dashboard | `account_id = "a655bacaf2b4cad0e2b51c5236a6b974"` |

  From here, you have two options, you can choose to publish to your own domain or you can choose to publish to [\<your-worker\>.\<your-subdomain\>.workers.dev](https://workers.dev).

#### Publishing to workers.dev

  If you want to publish to [workers.dev](https://workers.dev), you will first need to have a [workers.dev](https://workers.dev) subdomain registered. You can register a subdomain by executing:

```bash
  wrangler subdomain <name>
```

  After you have registered a subdomain, add `workers_dev` to your `wrangler.toml`.

| Key         | Value | Example              |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| workers_dev | true  | `workers_dev = true` |

#### Publishing to your own domain

If you would like to publish to your own domain, you will need to specify these three fields in your `wrangler.toml`.

| Key         | Value                                                        | Example                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| workers_dev | false                                                        | `workers_dev = false`                          |
| route       | The route you would like to publish to                       | `route = "example.com/my-worker/*"`            |
| zone_id     | Your Cloudflare zone ID, this can be found in the Cloudflare dashboard | `zone_id = "b6558acaf2b4cad1f2b51c5236a6b972"` |

#### Publishing the same code to multiple places

If you would like to be able to publish your code to multiple places, please see the documentation for [environments](/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments).

### üî¨ `preview`

  Preview your project using the [Cloudflare Workers preview service](https://cloudflareworkers.com/).

  By default, `wrangler preview` will only bundle your project a single time. To enable live preview,
  where Wrangler will continually update the preview service with the newest version of your project,
  pass the `--watch` flag:

  ```bash
  wrangler preview --watch
  ```

  You can optionally pass `get` or `post` and a `body` to this command. This will send a request to your
  worker on the preview service and return the response in your terminal. For example:

  GET requests can be sent with

  ```bash
  wrangler preview
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  wrangler preview get
  ```

  POST requests can be sent with

  ```bash
  wrangler preview post hello=hello
  ```

  Additionally, you can preview different environments. This is useful if you have different builds for different environments (like staging vs. production), but typically isn't needed. For more information see the [environments documentation](/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments).

#### Previewing on Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL 1/2)

##### Setting $BROWSER to your browser binary
  WSL is a Linux environment, so `wrangler` attempts to invoke `xdg-open` in order to open your browser. To make `wrangler preview` work with WSL, you should set your `$BROWSER` to the path of your browser binary.

  eg. `$ export BROWSER='/mnt/c/tools/firefox.exe'
  `
  Spaces in filepaths are not common in Linux, and some programs like `xdg-open` break on [paths with spaces](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3632#issuecomment-432821522). You can work around this by linking the binary to your `/usr/local/bin`.

  eg. $ ln -s '/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe' firefox
      $ export BROWSER=firefox

##### Setting $BROWSER to `wsl-open`
  Another option is to install [wsl-open](https://github.com/4U6U57/wsl-open#standalone) and set the `$BROWSER` env variable to `wsl-open`, via `wsl-open -w`. This ensures that `xdg-open` uses `wsl-open` when it attempts to open your browser.

  If you're using WSL 2, you will need to install `wsl-open` via their [standalone method](https://github.com/4U6U57/wsl-open#standalone) rather than through `npm`. This is because their npm package has not yet been updated with WSL 2 support.

### üóÇÔ∏è `kv`

  Interact with your Cloudflare Workers KV store. [Check out the docs.](/tooling/wrangler/kv_commands)
