To update your scripts and routes you can use the Cloudflare Dashboard, [Cloudflare API](../api/), or a tool like [the Serverless framework](serverless/) or [Terraform](terraform/).

Additionally, you can auto deploy Workers from GitHub with our [GitHub Action](github-action/).

We have also included some best practices for deploying with [Travis CI](travis-ci/) and [unit testing](unit-testing/) Workers.
