The Workers Runtime provides the following standardized APIs for use by scripts running at the Edge.

Methods highlighted in orange are only implemented in the scope of a [request context](../how-it-works/request-context).

## JavaScript Standards

All of the [standard built-in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) supported by the current Google Chrome stable release are supported, with a few notable exceptions:

- `eval()` is not allowed for security reasons.
- `new Function` is not allowed for security reasons.
- `Date.now()` returns the time of the last I/O; it does not advance during code execution.

## Service Worker API

[FetchEvent](./fetch-event)

[Cache API](./cache)

## Fetch API

[Fetch](./fetch) is implemented as expected within a Service Worker, with the exception of some features inapplicable to the edge, such as CORS-related properties.

## Streams API

The [Streams API](./streams) is useful for handling large chunks of data that are expected to exceed the [maximum memory](../limits) allowed.

## Web Crypto API

Cryptographically-secure random number generation
Digest (SHA family, MD5)
Sign and verify (HMAC (with SHA family, MD5), RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, ECDSA)
Encrypt and decrypt (AES-GCM, AES-CBC)
Key derivation (PBKDF2)
Key generation (AES-GCM, HMAC)
Raw key import/export for all of the above algorithms
## Web Global APIs

The following methods are available per the [Worker Global Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope):

[`atob()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/atob) - Decodes a string of data which has been encoded using base-64 encoding.

[`btoa()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa) - Creates a base-64 encoded ASCII string from a string of binary data.

[`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) - Schedules a function to execute every time a given number of milliseconds elapses.

[`clearInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval) - Cancels the repeated execution set using [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval).

[`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) - Schedules a function to execute in a given amount of time.

[`clearTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearTimeout) - Cancels the delayed execution set using [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout).

[`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch) - Starts the process of fetching a resource from the network. See [FetchAPI](./fetch).

## Encoding API

Both TextEncoder and TextDecoder support UTF-8 encoding/decoding.

## URL API

The URL API supports urls conforming to http and https schemes.
