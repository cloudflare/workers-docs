The [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) helps you develop and deploy serverless applications using [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/). This CLI provides structure, automation, and best practices to allow you to focus on building sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures, comprised of functions and events.

The Serverless Framework manages the infrastructure as a [Serverless Plugin](https://github.com/cloudflare/serverless-cloudflare-workers) that turns your version-controlled code into Workers globally deployed with one command. You only maintain [one config file](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/cloudflare/guide/quick-start#config) to direct exactly where Workers live. This gives you flexibility to modify your code, rebuild, and deploy in moments - without ever touching a browser.

Go serverless with Cloudflare Workers. Quickly get up to speed with this [quick start guide to the plugin](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/cloudflare/guide/intro/).

**Note:** The Serverless Framework does not currently support `workers.dev`. Track our progress on [this Github issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/serverless-cloudflare-workers/issues/36).
